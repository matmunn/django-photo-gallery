# Django Photo Gallery #

This is a photo gallery built on Django and Django Channels, that allows you to upload photos that will be displayed in a slideshow.

I created this app to display a photo gallery on a Raspberry Pi connected to a TV.

## Starting the project ##

This project relies on Docker and docker-compose being available.

Clone this repository, open the directory and run:
```
$ docker-compose up
```

Once provisioned the example should be available at http://localhost:8000/photos.

The admin interface will be available at http://localhost:8000/admin.

## Contributing ##

I'm happy to accept MRs if you think this project can be improved upon.
